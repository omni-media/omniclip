# Omniclip

### Free open source video editor for everybody

Omniclip runs entirely in your browser, and all you data stays on your device.

Designed for privacy, speed, and flexibility â€” it gives you full editing control without relying on cloud services or subscriptions. You can use it directly, or embed its components into your own web projects.

Omniclip uses modern browser APIs like WebCodecs for high performance video editing tasks.
